    fullDes: `Life isn’t always a straight road. It twists, turns, and sometimes throws us into storms we never expected. There are moments when giving up feels easier than holding on — when every effort seems to fall short, and every step forward feels like moving through mud. But the truth is, success isn’t built on the times we win; it’s built on the times we refuse to quit. Every challenge, every failure, and every setback carries a hidden lesson that shapes us into who we’re meant to be. When you feel lost or tired, remember that even the brightest mornings come after the darkest nights. The key is to keep moving, even when progress feels invisible. Every small effort counts. Every single day you show up, even when no one notices, brings you closer to your dream. Life rewards consistency, not perfection. You don’t have to take giant leaps — sometimes, the courage to take one small step is all it takes to change everything.`,
